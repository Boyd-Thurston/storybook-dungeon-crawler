# Storybook dungeon crawler

The base idea behind this project is to further hone my React.js skills and with the use of authentication and redux create a playable and savable browser based game. As the name suggests it will be storybook styled and this will be tied into every component once base functionality is installed. On a seperate sub-experiment I will attempt to illistrate the app my self, not as daugnting a feet as it sounds for me however there are a few new techniques that I am lookin at trying.

## Learning objectives:
- create a large react app making use of many components
- Experiment with a large volum of z-indexed elements
- tie authentication into every aspect of the app
- create savable gameplay 

## MVP
The MVP for this project may seem a little counter entuitive of the name however this is intended to go into many stretch goals that are eiser to work with the tech side of the project not waiting from me to finish the none tech work like the game story before I have a playable and play test able game mechanics functioning.

User Storys:
- [ ] As a new user I want to be able to register as a user for the APP
- [ ] As a user I want to be able to login to the app
- [ ] As a user I want to be able to log off the app

- [ ] As a user I want to be able to see my statistics of games I have played

## Stretch
The stretch is where I intend to actually bring in a story into the storybook dungeon crawler
- [ ] As a user I want to be able to play on the story game mode
- [ ] As a user I want to be able to see the stroy of the character I am playing (sylised statistics + more)
- [ ] As a user I want to be able to have multipul characters
- [ ] As a user I want to be able to play as different classes
- [ ] As a user I want to be able to add other characters to a party


## Z-Index Guidlines
This list is a guidline for making used of a varity of z-indexed elements and how they will appear on the app:
- 0-9 Background elements (e.g sceen backdrop)
- 10-19 midelground elements (e.g scene decoration)
- 20-29 foreground elements (e.g ecounter elements)
- 30-39 HUD overlay elements (e.g caracher images and game contols elements)
- 40-49 Web App controling elements (e.g. Nav Bar)
